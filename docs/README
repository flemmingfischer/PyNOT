The documentation has been moved to my github website: jkrogager.github.io/pynot/

Edit the source descriptions in source/ and compile the full site by running build_html.py

Links to the tasks will be structured into the sidebar automatically.

Note that the duplicate tasks `bias` and `corr` are defined under tasks/spex/
and linked to tasks/phot/
